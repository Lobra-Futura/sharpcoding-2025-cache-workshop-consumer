                You'll be pleased to know that while our furniture designs and marketing content
                are generated with the latest AI technology, the actual crafting is done by our talented artisans.
                Because, let's face it, while AI can create some stunning designs, it hasn't yet mastered the art of
                wielding a hammer or a chisel—our artisans have that covered!
